# Phase 2 Syllabus: Flex Program, 60 Week Pace

## Learning Objectives

Welcome to Phase 2! In the last phase, you learned the fundamentals of
JavaScript and how to use it to manipulate the DOM and respond to user events.
In this phase, you'll be learning the most popular frontend library in the
industry, React, and how it makes it easier to solve some of the same problems
you faced in Phase 1 with a new philosophy on how to structure your code.

By the end of the phase, you will be able to:

- Design a React component hierarchy based on a wireframe
- Use React to create components that interact with an API
- Incorporate client-side routing into a single-page application in React

Use the schedule below to make sure you're working through the material at
the right pace. The lessons marked with a ‚≠êÔ∏è are **milestones** that are useful
to check your understanding of the material you've learned. If you feel you're
falling behind, make sure to communicate with your instructor.

## Weeks 15 ‚Äì 17

To get started with React, you'll first learn React's core philosophy and some
of the modern JavaScript tools needed to get up and running with React. You'll
then learn how to use React to create **components**: small building blocks that
can be used to create more complex user interfaces. Finally, you'll learn about
**state** in React, and how it makes it easier to update the DOM.

**Total Assignments: (40)**

- Welcome to Phase 2 (1)
- Introduction to React (6)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Introduction to React Quiz
- Components and Props (16)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Putting it All Together: Components and Props
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Components and Props Quiz
- State and Events (16)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è State and Events Quiz
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Putting it All Together: State and Events
- Additional Practice: State and Events (2)

## Weeks 18 ‚Äì 20

Now that you've learned React's approach to building applications with regards
to components and state, it's time to expand on what you know by learning how to
**fetch data** in a React application to bring in data from external sources.
After that, you'll have learned all the core fundamentals of what it takes to
build a single-page application in React! Use the rest of this time to get more
practice putting all those fundamentals together with the Additional Practice
labs.

**Total Assignments: (31)**

- Side Effects and Data Fetching (8)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Putting it All Together: React Fetch CRUD Lab
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Side Effects and Data Fetching Quiz
- (Optional) React Under the Hood (4)
- Additional Practice (14)
  - **Note**: You don't have to complete every challenge in this section. Here
    are a few to prioritize:
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è **Mock Code Challenge: Plantsy**: similar format to the actual code
    challenge. Has a walkthrough video on the `solution-walkthrough` branch.
    We‚Äôll have a review lecture for this one Tuesday, so make sure you try it!
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è **Mock Code Challenge: gregslist**: similar format to the actual code
    challenge. Has a walkthrough video on the `solution-walkthrough` branch.
    Recommend saving this for later, when you want to test yourself on how ready
    you are for the code challenge.
  - **React Stocks**: good practice with filter, sort, and reusable components
  - **Toy Tales**: good practice a form and doing full CRUD with a `json-server` API
  - **React Pokemon Searcher**: good practice with a form and a search filter
  - **Sushi Saga**: good practice working with arrays and state, and sharing
    data between components. On the more challenging side, but has some fun new
    problems!
  - **Chatterbox** here for you if you like Scrimba and want a code
    challenge-style Scrimba exercise:

## Weeks 21 ‚Äì 23

**It's recommended that you take the Code Challenge for this Phase now**,
after you've worked through some of the Additional Practice assignments and are
ready to get feedback on your progress. After the code challenge, there's one
new concept to learn before starting on projects: **client-side routing**, which
allows you to create multiple "pages" with their own unique URLs in a
single-page application ü§Ø.

You can also check out the two optional sections. **Advanced Hooks** will cover
a few additional hooks like `useRef` and `useContext` to add new tools to your
React toolkit, and teach how to make your very own custom hooks. **Class
Components** explains how to work with slightly older class-based React code,
which you are still very likely to encounter in blog posts, documentation, and
at your first React job.

**Total Assignments: (19)**

- Client-Side Routing (7)
  - ‚≠êÔ∏è Client-Side Routing Quiz
- (Optional) Advanced Hooks (5)
- (Optional) Class Components (7)

## Weeks 24 ‚Äì 27

You know the deal: it's project time! You'll be building a new React application
from scratch using what you've learned up to this point. Projects are a great
way to reinforce what you know and force you to encounter new problems, while
giving you the opportunity to be creative and explore more tools from the React
ecosystem.

Details for the project can be found in the Milestones module.
